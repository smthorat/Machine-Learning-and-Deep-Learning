# Visualization Results

## 1. Class Distribution of Cancer Types
The dataset contains five cancer types with varying sample sizes.  
BRCA has the highest number of samples, while COAD has the least.  
This helps in understanding dataset balance before training.

## 2. Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix shows the performance of the classifier on the test data.  
Most predictions are correct, with only a few misclassifications.  
LUAD had two misclassified samples as BRCA, while COAD had one misclassification.

## 3. ROC Curve for Multiclass Classification
The ROC curve for each class is nearly perfect, with AUC = 1.00 for all classes.  
This suggests that the model is highly effective in distinguishing between different cancer types.

## Conclusion
The model performs exceptionally well, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
Minor misclassifications exist but are minimal.  
The ROC curve indicates a strong predictive ability, suggesting the classifier is well-trained.
